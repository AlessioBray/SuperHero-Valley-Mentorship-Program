# SuperHero Valley Mentorship Program
My path in the SuperHero Valley Mentorship Program.

This repository gathers all the informations that I gained through the mentorship program as a Mentee, with the aim of allowing future partecipants to the program to give a better structure to their meetings with their Mentors.

My suggestion is to fork this repository and start to write down your objectives (or something close to them) to reach with the program. This will greatly help you to decide how to use the time with your Mentor.

# How to use the meeting journal example

Let's start by cloning the repository on your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/AlessioBray/SuperHero-Valley-Mentorship-Program.git

then you are ready to create your first meeting journal.md

    cd SuperHero-Valley-Mentorship-Program
    cp meeting_journal_example.md ./journal/meeting_01.md
